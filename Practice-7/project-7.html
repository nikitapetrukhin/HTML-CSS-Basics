        <p>“As far as we can tell from a purely scientific viewpoint, human life has absolutely no meaning. Humans are the 
          outcome of blind evolutionary processes that operate without goal or purpose. Our actions are not part of some divine
           cosmic plan, and if planet earth were to blow up tomorrow morning, the universe would probably keep going about its 
           business as usual. As far as we can tell at this point, human subjectivity would not be missed. Hence any meaning 
           that people inscribe to their lives is just a delusion.”
